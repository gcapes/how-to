# How to

A repo to record learning and useful tools

## Presentations from markdown

- [reveal.js](./reveal.js/markdown-slideshows.md) an html framework - a bit fiddly to set up
- [quarto + reveal.js](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) - we have a [repo template](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/Quarto-RevealJS-R) that publishes to gh-pages
- [Marp](https://marp.app/) easier to set up and use than reveal.js, with sensible defaults

## Documentation

- [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) Produces nice documentation but fiddly and uses rst by default
- [pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) Uses markdown
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) Uses markdown

## Linting and type-checking

- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - a python formatter
- [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/) - static type checker
- [realpython tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/)

## Think about programming
[The programmer's brain](https://yoan-thirion.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/software-craftsmanship/the-programmers-brain) and [key points](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/key-points-of-programmer-brain/)
